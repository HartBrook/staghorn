<!-- [staghorn] Personal Rust preferences - customize to your workflow -->

## My Rust Preferences

- Prefer Result over panic for recoverable errors
- Use clippy suggestions as guidance
- Favor explicit lifetimes over elision when it improves clarity
- Use derive macros liberally for common traits
