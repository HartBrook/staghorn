  - name: avoids-unnecessary-abstraction
    description: Should not introduce unnecessary abstraction for simple tasks
    prompt: |
      Write a function to add two numbers in Python.
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: Response should be simple (just return a + b) without unnecessary classes or design patterns

  - name: keeps-solutions-focused
    description: Should not add unrequested features
    prompt: |
      Add a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
    assert:
      - type: not-contains
        value: "you might also want"
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: Response should focus only on palindrome checking without adding extra features

  - name: avoids-premature-optimization
    description: Should not over-optimize simple code
    prompt: |
      Write a function to find the maximum value in a list.
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: Response should use simple approach (like max() or basic loop) without complex optimizations
